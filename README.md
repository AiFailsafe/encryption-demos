# Encryption Demos
Resources for learning encryption techniques in a simple way. Simplicity is key here as this resource is to help people with little to no knowledge of encryption techniques understand how encryption works.
Some of the more advanced encryption methods in this repository have been dulled down in order to make it easier to understand the processes.

**These encryption methods shown here are for educational purposes only and should _not_ be used in any real world situationsâ€¦ ever!**
